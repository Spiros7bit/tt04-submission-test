# What is a Pseudo Random Number Generator 

This circuit is a Pseudo Random Number Generator [(PRNG)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pseudorandom_number_generator) 

A pseudorandom number generator (PRNG), also known as a deterministic random bit generator (DRBG), is an algorithm for generating a sequence of numbers whose properties approximate the properties of sequences of random numbers. The PRNG-generated sequence is not truly random, because it is completely determined by an initial value, called the PRNG's seed (which may include truly random values).

###### There are also Real Random Number Generator [(TRNG)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hardware_random_number_generator)
###### is a device that generates random numbers from a physical process capable of producing entropy (in other words, the device always has access to a physical entropy source)


# Implementation details

-In this project as source of pseudo-randomness we used 2 LFSR's. One that works with 8-bit and one with 16-bit. The circuit don't have input data,  just 1 clock and 1 enable pin. The output will be on two 7 segment displays, so 14 output pins. <br />
-The 16-bit LFSR produces the input of a 16-to-8 multiplexer and the 8-bit LFSR produces the selection bits of 16-to-8 multiplexer.  <br />
-The 16-to-8 multiplexer is implemented by 8 2-to-1 multiplexers.  <br />
-In the final stage the data are converted to BCD format and are shown in two 7-segment displays. The format is hexadecimal.

| # | Input  | Output |
| ----- | ----- | ------ |
| 0     | CLK | Segment0 A |
| 1     | EN | Segment0 B |
| 2     | RST_N | Segment0 C |
| 3     | NONE | Segment0 D |
| 4     | NONE | Segment0 E |
| 5     | NONE | Segment0 F |
| 6     | NONE | Segment0 G |
| 7     | NONE | Segment1 A |
| 8     | NONE | Segment1 B |
| 9     | NONE | Segment1 C |
| 10    | NONE | Segment1 D |
| 11    | NONE | Segment1 E |
| 12    | NONE | Segment1 F |
| 13    | NONE | Segment1 G |

## Test

Test done in FPGA Cyclone V [De1-Soc Board](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/partner/showcase/offering/a5b3b0000004cbaAAA/de1soc-board.html)

## Idea

The idea for the implementation of this cell came from the paper: [Dopingless Transistor Based Hybrid Oscillator Arbiter Physical Unclonable Function](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/7987589)
